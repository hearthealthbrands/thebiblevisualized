        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            When we read the story of David and Goliath, it’s easy for the giant to feel like a cartoon villain—a fairytale monster that isn't quite real. But the biblical writers were specific. At "six cubits and a span," Goliath stood nearly nine feet, nine inches tall.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's visualization puts that into jarring perspective. We look at modern titans like Shaq or Wembanyama with awe. Yet, standing next to the Philistine champion, even these giants look human. Goliath was a walking siege engine, covered in 125 pounds of bronze armor. The Israelites weren't cowards; they were logically terrified of an impossible physical reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all face impossible giants. They may not hold spears, but they loom just as large: a crushing diagnosis, insurmountable debt, deep-seated anxiety, or a broken relationship. They stand over us, casting a shadow that makes us feel small, weak, and foolish for even trying.
        </p>
        <p>
            The power of 1 Samuel 17 is not that David was a better warrior. It was that David brought a different reality to the battlefield. Goliath trusted in the visible weight of his bronze; David trusted in the invisible weight of Glory. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you only measure your strength against the size of your problem, you will always lose heart. The secret is to stop measuring yourself against the giant, and start measuring the giant against God.Ql
