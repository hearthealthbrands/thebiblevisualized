        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Thanksgiving is often loud. It is a day of parades, football, kitchen chaos, and crowded tables. But the psalmists often speak of gratitude as a "gate"—a way to enter into God's presence. Before the meal begins, there is a moment of quiet anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's visualization, we focus on that quiet moment. The sun is low, the table is set, and the harvest is gathered. It is a reminder that the "goodness" of the Lord isn't just in the big miracles, but in the daily bread, the warm light, and the endurance of His love.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are feeling overwhelmed by the noise of the holiday today, take a moment to look at the light. His love endures longer than the feast, longer than the season, and longer than our circumstances.
