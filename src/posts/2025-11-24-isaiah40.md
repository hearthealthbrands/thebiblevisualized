        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            There is a profound difference between being "tired" and being "weary." Tiredness comes from a long day; weariness comes from a long season. It is a deep, soul-level fracture where we feel our internal resources have run dry.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Japanese art of <em>Kintsugi</em>, broken pottery is not thrown away. Instead, the cracks are filled with liquid gold. The piece becomes more beautiful and more valuable <em>because</em> it was broken.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the promise of Isaiah 40:29. God does not demand that we hide our cracks or pretend to be strong. He waits for us to admit our weakness so He can pour His power into the gaps. If you are feeling fragile today, do not despair. You are simply in the perfect position to be filled with gold.
