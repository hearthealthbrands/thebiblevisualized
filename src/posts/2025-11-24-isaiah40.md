        <h3>Morning Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            There is a profound difference between being "tired" and being "weary." Tiredness comes from a long day; weariness comes from a long season. It is a deep, soul-level exhaustion where your internal resources are completely tapped out.
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's visualization, I wanted to capture that contrast—the darkness of exhaustion meeting the sudden, piercing light of divine strength. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The beauty of this promise in Isaiah is that God does not demand strength from us; He supplies it to us. He doesn't ask the weak to "try harder." He offers an exchange: our weakness for His power. If you are feeling empty today, you are in the perfect position to be filled.
