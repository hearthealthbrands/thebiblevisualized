        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            It is easy to treat the story of David and Goliath as a metaphor. We talk about "facing our giants" as if Goliath were merely a symbol of difficulty. But the biblical text is jarringly specific: "Six cubits and a span."
        </p>
        <p>
            When we visualize that measurement (approx. 9'9") next to the greatest athletes of our time, the story changes. We see Steph Curry (6'2") and Luka Dončić (6'7")—men we consider tall—looking like children. Even Victor Wembanyama, the 7'4" modern anomaly, is dwarfed by the Philistine champion.
        </p>
        <p>
            This visualization validates the fear of the Israelite army. They weren't cowards; they were facing a literal monster. A man of this size, clad in 125 pounds of bronze scale armor, was a walking siege engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>This makes David’s faith even more unreasonable.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            David didn't ignore the physical reality; he just acknowledged a greater spiritual reality. While the army measured themselves against Goliath and came up short, David measured Goliath against God and realized the giant was too small.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever giant is standing in front of you today—whether it's financial, medical, or relational—stop measuring it against your own strength. Measure it against the Creator of the universe.
