        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            We live in an era of "pen and ink." We have more ways to communicate than any generation in history—texts, DMs, emails, and video calls. Yet, the Apostle John’s ancient sentiment rings louder than ever: <em>I do not want to write to you with pen and ink.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a limit to digital connection. Text on a screen can convey information, but it cannot convey presence. It cannot replicate the scraping of chairs against a wooden floor, the passing of plates, or the warmth of a shared meal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Christmas is, at its core, a celebration of presence. God did not send a letter; He sent a Person. He moved from "pen and ink" prophecy to "face to face" reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The image of an empty chair at a set table isn't meant to feel lonely; it is meant to feel expectant. It is an invitation. The best part of this season isn't what is under the tree, but who is around the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, prioritize the physical. Put down the "pen and ink" and make space to see the people you love—face to face.
