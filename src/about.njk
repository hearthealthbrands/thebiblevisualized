    <h1>Faith, Visualized.</h1>
    
    <p class="intro-text">
        Scripture is often described as "living and active," yet we often read it as static text on a page. 
        <strong>The Bible Visualized</strong> is a project dedicated to changing that perspective.

        <h3>The Mission</h3>
        <p>
            This project was born from a simple morning routine. In my daily reading, I found myself trying to imagine the vivid imagery described in the verses—the pastures of Psalm 23, the storms of the Gospels, or the abstract peace of the Epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
            By combining the timeless truth of the Bible with the emerging capability of Artificial Intelligence, I aim to bring these verses to life in a new way. Some days the art is literal; other days it is abstract and emotive.

            The goal is simple: <strong>to stop the scroll.</strong> In a digital world filled with noise, I hope these images provide a moment of pause, a spark of curiosity, and an invitation to engage deeper with the Word of God.
